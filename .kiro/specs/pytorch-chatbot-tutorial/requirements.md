# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a comprehensive PyTorch machine learning tutorial series focused on building a chatbot from scratch. The tutorial series is designed as a learning project that teaches ML fundamentals through practical implementation, progressing from basic PyTorch concepts to advanced chatbot implementations. The series will be structured as sequential Jupyter notebooks with detailed documentation, progressive complexity, and educational focus to help learners understand both the "how" and "why" of machine learning concepts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a machine learning student, I want a structured tutorial series that starts with PyTorch basics, so that I can build foundational knowledge before tackling complex chatbot implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tutorial series is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide a "chatbot" directory in the courses folder
2. WHEN a learner opens the first notebook THEN the system SHALL present PyTorch fundamentals including tensor operations, basic mathematical operations, and PyTorch-specific implementations
3. WHEN each code block is executed THEN the system SHALL include detailed comments explaining the purpose, functionality, and underlying mathematical concepts
4. IF a learner is new to PyTorch THEN the system SHALL provide clear explanations of PyTorch-specific syntax and conventions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a learner following the tutorial, I want each notebook to build upon previous concepts in a logical progression, so that I can develop understanding incrementally without knowledge gaps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN notebooks are numbered sequentially THEN the system SHALL ensure each notebook builds upon concepts from previous notebooks
2. WHEN a new concept is introduced THEN the system SHALL reference and connect it to previously covered material
3. WHEN progressing through the series THEN the system SHALL cover data preprocessing, tokenization, neural network architectures, training, evaluation, and inference in logical order
4. IF a complex concept is introduced THEN the system SHALL break it down into smaller, understandable components

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student learning NLP and chatbot development, I want comprehensive documentation and explanations, so that I understand the reasoning behind each implementation decision and can apply the concepts to other projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any code block is presented THEN the system SHALL include detailed comments explaining purpose, functionality, and mathematical concepts
2. WHEN ML operations are performed THEN the system SHALL explain the underlying mathematical concepts and their relevance to chatbot functionality
3. WHEN design decisions are made THEN the system SHALL document the rationale and trade-offs considered
4. WHEN common pitfalls exist THEN the system SHALL include debugging tips and explanations of potential issues

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a practical learner, I want working code examples with clear input/output demonstrations, so that I can execute the code and see immediate results while understanding what each step accomplishes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code examples are provided THEN the system SHALL ensure all code can be executed successfully
2. WHEN each processing step occurs THEN the system SHALL provide clear explanations of input data format and expected output
3. WHEN training occurs THEN the system SHALL include visualization of training progress and results
4. WHEN the chatbot is implemented THEN the system SHALL provide working inference examples with sample conversations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a learner working with predefined datasets, I want the tutorial to use accessible training data and context, so that I can focus on learning ML concepts without spending time on data collection and preparation complexities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training data is needed THEN the system SHALL provide predefined datasets suitable for chatbot training
2. WHEN data preprocessing is demonstrated THEN the system SHALL use the predefined context to show realistic data preparation steps
3. WHEN tokenization is taught THEN the system SHALL demonstrate techniques using the provided training data
4. IF custom datasets are used THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for data format and structure requirements

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer who prefers containerized environments, I want setup instructions for a reproducible PyTorch development environment, so that I can run the tutorials consistently across different systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the development environment THEN the system SHALL provide Docker Compose configuration for PyTorch development
2. WHEN the environment is configured THEN the system SHALL include all necessary dependencies for running Jupyter notebooks and PyTorch operations
3. WHEN GPU acceleration is available THEN the system SHALL provide configuration options for CUDA support
4. WHEN the environment is started THEN the system SHALL ensure all notebooks can access required libraries and datasets

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an educational content consumer, I want the tutorial to prioritize learning and understanding over production-ready code, so that I can focus on grasping fundamental concepts rather than implementation details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN concepts are explained THEN the system SHALL prioritize clarity and understanding over code optimization
2. WHEN ML theory is relevant THEN the system SHALL include appropriate theoretical background and references
3. WHEN implementation choices are made THEN the system SHALL explain the educational value and learning objectives
4. WHEN debugging scenarios arise THEN the system SHALL use them as teaching opportunities to explain common issues and solutions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a visual learner, I want training progress visualization and result demonstrations, so that I can understand model performance and behavior throughout the training process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN model training occurs THEN the system SHALL provide visualizations of loss curves, accuracy metrics, and training progress
2. WHEN model evaluation happens THEN the system SHALL display performance metrics in both numerical and graphical formats
3. WHEN the chatbot generates responses THEN the system SHALL demonstrate the inference process with step-by-step explanations
4. WHEN different model architectures are compared THEN the system SHALL provide visual comparisons of their performance and characteristics
