# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a complete AI chatbot application with a FastAPI backend, React frontend, and PyTorch-based language model integration. The application will be containerized using Docker Compose and deployed in the `/courses/chatbotR1` directory. The system will provide a modern chat interface where users can interact with an AI assistant powered by an open-source language model.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with an AI chatbot through a web interface, so that I can have natural conversations and get helpful responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the web application THEN the system SHALL display a clean chat interface with message input field
2. WHEN a user types a message and sends it THEN the system SHALL display the message in the chat history immediately
3. WHEN the AI processes the message THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator during response generation
4. WHEN the AI generates a response THEN the system SHALL display the response in the chat history with proper formatting
5. WHEN multiple messages are exchanged THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context and history

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a FastAPI backend that handles chat requests efficiently, so that the application can process user messages and generate AI responses reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend starts THEN the system SHALL expose REST API endpoints for chat interactions
2. WHEN a POST request is made to /chat endpoint THEN the system SHALL accept message payload and return AI response
3. WHEN processing a chat request THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context across multiple messages
4. WHEN an error occurs during processing THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
5. WHEN the API receives malformed requests THEN the system SHALL validate input and return descriptive error responses

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want PyTorch integration for language model inference, so that the application can generate intelligent responses using open-source models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load a pre-trained language model efficiently
2. WHEN a user message is received THEN the system SHALL use PyTorch to generate contextual responses
3. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL optimize for performance and resource usage
4. WHEN the model processes text THEN the system SHALL handle tokenization and text preprocessing properly
5. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL implement proper model management and cleanup

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a React frontend that provides an intuitive chat experience, so that users can easily interact with the AI chatbot.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend loads THEN the system SHALL display a responsive chat interface compatible with modern browsers
2. WHEN a user types a message THEN the system SHALL provide real-time input validation and character limits
3. WHEN messages are sent THEN the system SHALL make HTTP requests to the FastAPI backend asynchronously
4. WHEN responses are received THEN the system SHALL update the chat history without page refresh
5. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages to the user

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Docker Compose configuration for easy development setup, so that the entire application stack can be run with a single command.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN docker-compose up is executed THEN the system SHALL start both frontend and backend services
2. WHEN services start THEN the system SHALL configure proper networking between React and FastAPI containers
3. WHEN development changes are made THEN the system SHALL support hot reloading for both frontend and backend
4. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL expose appropriate ports for local development access
5. WHEN containers are stopped THEN the system SHALL properly cleanup resources and volumes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive project structure and documentation, so that the codebase is maintainable and easy to understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is created THEN the system SHALL organize files in logical directory structure
2. WHEN dependencies are needed THEN the system SHALL provide requirements.txt and package.json files
3. WHEN setup is required THEN the system SHALL include clear installation and running instructions
4. WHEN configuration is needed THEN the system SHALL provide environment variables and config files
5. WHEN code is written THEN the system SHALL follow best practices for both Python and JavaScript/TypeScript

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat interface to handle conversation state properly, so that I can have coherent multi-turn conversations with the AI.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I send multiple messages THEN the system SHALL remember previous messages in the conversation
2. WHEN the AI responds THEN the system SHALL consider the full conversation context
3. WHEN I refresh the page THEN the system SHALL persist conversation history
4. WHEN conversations get long THEN the system SHALL handle context window limitations gracefully
5. WHEN I start a new conversation THEN the system SHALL create a new conversation thread

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage multiple conversations through a sidebar interface, so that I can switch between different chat sessions and organize my interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a sidebar showing all previous conversations
2. WHEN I start a new conversation THEN the system SHALL create a new conversation entry in the sidebar
3. WHEN I click on a conversation in the sidebar THEN the system SHALL load and display that conversation's history
4. WHEN conversations are listed THEN the system SHALL show conversation titles or preview text for easy identification
5. WHEN I want to delete a conversation THEN the system SHALL provide an option to remove conversations from the sidebar
6. WHEN conversations are created THEN the system SHALL automatically generate meaningful titles based on the first message or topic
